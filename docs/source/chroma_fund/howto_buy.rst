Making a Committment
====================

Making a committment to a fund pledges an amount to the fund and authorizes the fund to pull that amount from a bank account. The process includes entering the amount being pledging and authorizing an account.

Reviewing Fund 
--------------

The fund page will give you an overview of the fund, a bio of the fund manager, and a prospectus detailing more information. As companies are added to the fund they will be listed on the fund page.

Committing To a Fund
--------------------

An investor will commit to a fund by selecting **SETUP MY ACCOUNT**.

The account setup includes any pre-qualifying requirements (income verification, etc) and attaching their bank account.

* ACH Authorization: Select their bank and enable ACH payments.
