Making a Committment
====================

Making a committment to a fund pledges an amount to the fund and authorizes the fund to pull that amount from a bank account. The process includes entering the amount being pledging and authorizing an account.

Reviewing Fund 
--------------

The fund page will give you an overview of the fund, a bio of the fund manager, and a prospectus detailing more information. As companies are added to the fund they will be listed on the fund page.

Committing To a Fund
--------------------

An investor will commit to a fund by selecting **SETUP MY ACCOUNT**.

The account setup includes any pre-qualifying requirements (income verification, etc) and attaching their bank account.

* ACH Authorization: Select their bank and enable ACH payments.

Making a Capital Call
---------------------

Once you have onboarded a Business you will make a Capital Call. 

As an Admin go to the Admin section in the menu bar.

In the Fund Commands select **Capital Calls**

You will see a list of previous capital calls and all the Businesses in the fund. Enter the amount of the capital call and select **Make a Call** on the appropriate Business.

In the list of capital calls select **show** under payouts to inspect the details of a previous capital call.
