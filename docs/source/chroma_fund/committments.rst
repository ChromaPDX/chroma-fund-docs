Making a Committment
====================

Investors make a committment to a fund pledging an amount to be invested. The fund can then authorize the transfer of portions of the total committed amount from the Investor to the Business.

Reviewing Fund 
--------------

The fund page gives the Investor an overview of your fund, the bio of the fund manager, and a link to download the prospectus detailing more information.

Committing To a Fund
--------------------

An Investor commits to a fund by selecting **SETUP MY ACCOUNT** on the fund page.

The account setup includes any pre-qualifying requirements (income verification, etc) and attaching their bank account.

* ACH Authorization: Select their bank and enable ACH payments.

Making a Capital Call
---------------------

Once you have onboarded a Business you can make a Capital Call. 

As the Fund Admin, go to the Admin section in the menu bar.

In the Fund Commands select **Capital Calls**

You will see a list of previous capital calls and all the Businesses in the fund. Enter the amount of the capital call and select **Make a Call** on the appropriate Business.

In the list of capital calls select **show** under payouts to inspect the details of a previous capital call.
